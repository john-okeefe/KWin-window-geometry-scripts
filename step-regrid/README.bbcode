Adds keyboard shortcuts to stepwise reshape the window grid, that is, resize the active or all windows from the center axes depending of their position:
Example: shift rightwards (analogous for leftwards/upwards/downwards):[list]
  [*] windows at the left screen edge: grow to right
  [*] windows at the right screen edge: shrink from left
  [*] windows in the middle: move right
  [*] windows in full width: do nothing[/list]Whether to resize only the active or all present windows, as well as the step sizes and the keyboard shortcuts are configurable.
